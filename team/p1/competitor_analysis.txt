Down To Lunch competes against our value proposition because it's intended purpose is to find friends you already know to grab lunch (or any mean) with.  The philosophy behind EatWithFriends is that you can find a complete stranger to eat with who is also using the app.  Also, in addition to the social component of our application, we provide informative components about the menus and recipe ingredients, as well as a review system for the dining options.  

Down To Lunch is a direct competitor, and they do have a really clean and simple interface.  Also, while still a small organization with only 10 thousand downloads from the Google Play store, they are growing fast and already have a decent grasp on the college student population.  What they lack is a way for the users to review their experience.  This is where we need to make EatWithFriends stand out, since it's the area where we are most unique and don't yet face competition.  Furthermore, one of Down To Lunch's strengths might also be a weakness in users eyes.  Down To Lunch is convenient because it's as simple as pressing the big button on the screen to declare your interest in going to lunch with someone.  However, sometimes it might be nice to view whether certain friends are available so that you don't get stuck eating with someone you'd rather avoid.  

The big takeaway from our analysis of Down To Lunch is that the greatest chance of failure is simply not attracting enough attention.  It's important that enough different features are added to EatWithFriends to make it able to stand apart from Down To Lunch.  This would mean always having accurate menus posted and making the review system useful enough for someone to want to use the app.
